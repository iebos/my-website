I am a PhD student exploring how we can better understand complex systems with data-driven models that help translate mobility, weather, and health data into actionable insights. My work focuses on developing hybrid modeling frameworks that couple agent-based models with compartmental ODE models for scalable and efficient infectious disease simulation. 

I am particularly interested in modeling the interaction between individual behavior, mobility, and interventions. Having first explored these relationships from a social science perspective, I became increasingly drawn to computational modeling in epidemiology, public health, and population modeling as a way to better understand complex health dynamics.

<!-- I am a researcher and PhD student at [Zuse Institue Berlin, Department for Visual and Data-centric Computing, Bioinformatics in Medicine group](). 

My research interests are Machine learning for health applications, hybrid modeling, multimodal sensor data integration, time series analysis, agent-based simulation, data-driven policy modeling.
Viz, bio group
I recently graduated the master's program [Methodology & Statistics in the Behavioral, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University. While working on my bachelor's degree in Sociology, I became enthusiastic about the potential of novel data sources in social and epidemiological research.

Until recently, I interned and wrote my thesis at Statistics Netherlands (CBS). In this research project, we utilised traffic loop sensor data to improve models that estimate traffic on a nationwide scale. The thesis was supervised by Dr. [Peter Lugtig](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/plugtig) and [Yvonne Gootzen](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/over-ons/werken-bij/_testimonials/yvonne-gootzen-statistisch-onderzoeker).  -->
