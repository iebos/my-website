Viz, bio group
I recently graduated the master's program [Methodology & Statistics in the Behavioral, Biomedical and Social Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University. While working on my bachelor's degree in Sociology, I became enthusiastic about the potential of novel data sources in social and epidemiological research.

Until recently, I interned and wrote my thesis at Statistics Netherlands (CBS). In this research project, we utilised traffic loop sensor data to improve models that estimate traffic on a nationwide scale. The thesis was supervised by Dr. [Peter Lugtig](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/plugtig) and [Yvonne Gootzen](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/over-ons/werken-bij/_testimonials/yvonne-gootzen-statistisch-onderzoeker).
